# CSharp Simple Coding Katas

##What is a code kata?
A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

##Simple katas
In any discipline we have different level of exercises, in this set you will find a collection of simple programming katas that I have tested and implemented.

These katas comply with the following criteria:

- Can be implemented and tested in less than 10 minutes
- Follows the Single Responsability Principle
- Illustrates a common but interesting programming problem
- The solution is well known
