## What is a code kata?
A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

## Simple katas
In any discipline we have a different level of exercises, in this set, you will find a collection of simple programming katas that I have tested and implemented.

## Katas Criteria

1. Can be implemented and tested in less than 10 minutes.
2. Follows the Single Responsibility Principle.
3. Illustrates a common but interesting programming problem.
4. The solution is well known.

# Hands-On

Here are all the details needed in order to *get* the code, *build*, *test* and contribute to this project.

## Get the source code

```sh
 git clone https://github.com/ernestohs/csharp.katas.simple.git
```

## Build
